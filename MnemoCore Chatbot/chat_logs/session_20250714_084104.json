    "content": "An SQL Query, or Structured Query Language Query, is a command used to communicate with a database to perform specific operations such as retrieving data, inserting new data, updating existing data, or deleting data. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Retrieving Data:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Customers;\n```\nThis query retrieves all data from the \"Customers\" table.\n\n2. Retrieving Specific Data:\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerName, ContactName FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany';\n```\nThis query retrieves the names of customers and their contacts from the \"Customers\" table where the country is Germany.\n\n3. Inserting Data:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Johnny', 'USA');\n```\nThis query inserts a new row into the \"Customers\" table with the specified values.\n\n4. Updating Data:\n```sql\nUPDATE Customers SET ContactName='Jane' WHERE CustomerName='John';\n```\nThis query updates the \"ContactName\" to 'Jane' for the customer named 'John' in the \"Customers\" table.\n\n5. Deleting Data:\n```sql\nDELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='John';\n```\nThis query deletes the row from the \"Customers\" table where the \"CustomerName\" is 'John'.\n\nThese are basic examples, and SQL queries can be much more complex, involving multiple tables, conditions, and functions."

The application handles \"big data\" from a train provider's website, which includes high volume, velocity, and variety (like train schedules, locations, and delays). The data is then transformed and loaded into a structured format for easy processing and querying. This is done using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline."
