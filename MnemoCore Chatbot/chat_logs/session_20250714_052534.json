    "content": "An SQL query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. This data may be generated as results stored in a table, file, or other data structure. SQL is a standard language for relational database management systems.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the caching system in the app?\nAnswer: The caching system in the app serves to reduce data usage and speed up response times. It achieves this by storing frequently accessed data in a cache, allowing the app to serve this data quickly without needing to repeatedly query the API for the same information. This is particularly beneficial for real-time queries and viewing time-series data for specific trains.\n\nQuestion: What issues were identified with the app?\nAnswer: The app had several issues. It crashed in edge cases, particularly when dealing with very large data sets or simultaneous multiple queries. This was mainly due to the app's handling of memory and database queries. Additionally, the app's performance was inconsistent, and there were issues with the accuracy of time-series data retrieval.\n\nQuestion: How does the app handle real-time queries?\nAnswer: The app handles real-time queries by serving as a user-friendly interface between the user and the API. It allows users to fetch details of all trains running on a railway line in real-time. It also enables users to search for the current running status of a single train.\n\nQuestion: What parameters can be used to view time-series data for a specific train?\nAnswer: The time-series data for a specific train can be viewed based on parameters such as the day of the week and the arrival station. This allows users to analyze the train's performance and schedule based on these specific parameters.\n\nQuestion: What is the cache hit rate?\nAnswer: The cache hit rate is a measure of the efficiency of the caching system. It describes the percentage of requests that are served from the cache, as opposed to being served from the API. A higher cache hit rate indicates a more efficient caching system, as it means that more requests are being served from the cache, reducing the need for API queries and thus saving data and improving response times.\n\nQuestion: What is the official API response time?\nAnswer: The official API response time refers to the time it takes for the mobile application to initiate a connection to the API and retrieve the relevant data. This is an important measure of the app's performance, as a longer response time can negatively impact the user experience.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the caching system in the app?\nAnswer: The purpose of the caching system in the app is to improve the efficiency and performance of the app by reducing data usage and speeding up response times. It does this by storing frequently accessed data in a cache, allowing the app to serve this data quickly without needing to repeatedly query the API for the same information. This is particularly beneficial for real-time queries and viewing time-series data for specific trains.\n\nQuestion: What is the cache hit rate?\nAnswer: The cache hit rate is a measure of the effectiveness of the caching system.
